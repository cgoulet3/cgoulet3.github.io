    <p id ="about">
        Hi! I'm Chase Goulet, a 2nd year Computational Media Major from North Kingstown, Rhode Island. Welcome to my portfolio. 
        <br/>
        Here you can find some examples of my photo manipulation work using photoshop and my 3D environment design work using Minecraft. I also do graphic, web, and UX design, although I have not uploaded those projects here yet. My threads are currently People and Interaction Design because I hope to pursue a career in UX design after college. I'm super passionate about combining design with technology and optimizing a user's experience of a product. In my spare time, I enjoy watching cinema and TV and doing photoshoots around Atlanta.
